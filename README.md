Project-Glu
===========

Project-Glu is my attempt glue some existing things together to make managing my son's T1D a little easier/safer. Currently only focused on data from the G4, but later I'd like to include pump/activity tracker data.

current status
--------------

I have a [forked](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/original-android-cgm) version of [@jcostik](https://twitter.com/jcostik)'s [original-android-app](https://github.com/hackingtype1/original-android-cgm) running on ~~my old/rooted Galaxy Nexus~~ a new Moto G and have it posting simple json to [this](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/project-glu) node.js/express.js/angular.js/mongo app.

I have the android app posting to the web app running locally and at AWS.

next steps
